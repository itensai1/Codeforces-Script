# Codeforces-Script
A python script that uses web scraping and codeforces API to get the number of problems solved by each contestant in a given group.

<h4>This script is used to collect data about contestants in a private group that you are a manager in .</h4>
<h4>I used [this library]( https://github.com/VadVergasov/CodeforcesApiPy ) to use Codeforces API </h4>
